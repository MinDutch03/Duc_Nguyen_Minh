# Project Problems Overview

This README outlines three distinct problem areas addressed in our projects, along with their corresponding solutions and implementation details.

## Problem 4: Summation to n - Algorithm Efficiency Analysis

### Problem Description
Finding the sum of integers from 1 to n using different algorithmic approaches.

### Solutions
1. **Iterative Approach (For Loop)**
   - Simple sequential addition
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Intuitive but inefficient for large inputs

2. **Mathematical Formula**
   - Uses sum = n(n+1)/2
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Most efficient for large values of n

3. **Recursive Approach**
   - Breaks down into subproblems
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)
   - Potential stack overflow with large inputs

### Recommendation
The mathematical formula implementation is superior for performance, especially with large input values.

## Problem 5: RESTful CRUD API with Express and TypeScript

### Problem Description
Building a robust, type-safe API for resource management with filtering, validation, and complete testing coverage.

### Key Features
- Complete CRUD operations
- MongoDB integration via Mongoose
- TypeScript for type safety
- Input validation middleware
- Query filtering capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for all endpoints

### Implementation Details
- **Project Structure**: Organized into controllers, models, routes, and middleware
- **Database Model**: Resources with name, description, category, and status
- **API Endpoints**:
  - POST `/api/resources` - Create resource
  - GET `/api/resources` - List resources with filtering
  - GET `/api/resources/:id` - Get specific resource
  - PUT `/api/resources/:id` - Update resource
  - DELETE `/api/resources/:id` - Delete resource
- **Testing**: Jest with MongoDB memory server for isolated testing

## Problem 6: Score Service for Real-time Leaderboard System

### Problem Description
Creating a secure, scalable service to handle user score updates and maintain a real-time leaderboard with anti-fraud protections.

### Key Components
- **Score Update API**: Processes authenticated score update requests
- **Authorization Service**: Validates user permissions
- **Scoreboard Manager**: Maintains top 10 leaderboard
- **WebSocket Service**: Pushes real-time updates
- **Rate Limiter**: Prevents abuse of the API
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns
- **Cache Hierarchy**: Multi-level caching for performance

### Security Measures
- JWT authentication
- Action proof validation
- Challenge-response system
- Rate limiting
- Action verification
- Fraud detection systems
- Optional two-factor verification for high-value actions

### Performance Considerations
- Cache hierarchy implementation
- Database read/write separation
- Incremental WebSocket updates
- Regional deployment for low latency
- Microservice decomposition
- Database sharding strategy

### Testing Strategy
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Score update validation tests
- Rate limiting verification
- WebSocket broadcast tests
- End-to-end integration tests
